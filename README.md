<h1 align="center">Heart Attack Risk Prediction</h1>

[![Project Overview](/images/project_overview.png)](https://github.com/your_username/heart-attack-risk-prediction)

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Getting Started

I'm cool with anyone using the code or parts of the code for their own set of analysis, it is open source so people can learn from it and adapt it. However, I would encourage you to modify the the code to suit the new data or purpose for effective learning purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Google account and access to Google Colab.

### Opening the Project in Google Colab

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ManishAshok/heart-attack-risk-prediction.git
    ```

2. Open the notebook in Google Colab:

    - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    - Click on `File > Upload notebook`.
    - Select `Final_Project_Manish_Ashok.ipynb` from your cloned repository.

3. Alternatively, you can open the notebook directly in Google Colab by clicking on this badge:

## Project Objectives

### Objective 1: Lifestyle Factors

The project investigates how lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption influence heart attack risks.

### Objective 2: Demographic Patterns

The analysis explores demographic patterns to understand how age, gender, and other demographic factors contribute to heart attack risks.

### Objective 3: Medical History Contribution

This section examines the impact of medical history on heart attack risks, including previous conditions, family history, and other relevant factors.

## Data Visualization

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate the findings:

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>How do I update the dataset?</summary>
  
  Replace the existing dataset with a new one in the same format, and rerun the analysis steps in Google Colab. Adjust any relevant parameters in the analysis to accommodate changes in the data structure or size.

<details>
  <summary>Can I use this analysis for other medical datasets?</summary>
  
  Yes, you can adapt the analysis for other medical datasets by modifying the code to suit the new data. Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and formatted similarly before applying the existing code.
